<h1>Bugs and Problems</h1>
<h2>MidiRouter</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>I am still trying to get the program to write a MIDI file.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Java Core Library</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>There is a problem with the javax.sound.midi package.  For
       a given MidiDevice.Info object, 
       MidiSystem.getMidiDevice(MidiDevice.Info)
       should consistently return the same MidiDevice object.  However,
       each call to getMidiDevice creates a new instance and returns
       the object.  All of the returned MidiDevice objects will return
       the same MidiDevice.Info object when running the method
       MidiDevice.getDeviceInfo().</p></li>
<li><p>Each call to MidiSystem.getSequencer() and
       MidiSystem.getSynthesizer() should return the default
       sequencer and synthesizer, respectively.  However, these 
       methods return a new object for each call.  Each device produced
       by getSynthesizer will produce the same MidiDevice.Info object,
       and the same applies to the objects returned by getSequencer.</p></li>
<li><p>The objects created by MidiSystem.getReceiver() and
       MidiSystem.getTransmitter() are ambiguous given the
       documentation since there is no way of verifying which
       device they belong to.  I would recommend against using
       these methods.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>CoreMidi4J</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Closing a transmitter does not seem to remove the item from the
       transmitter list.  The list of devices says CoreMidi4J
       but I don't seem to be running the package.</p></li>

<h2>Javadoc</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The Javadoc libraries are not linking to other Javadoc libraries.
       This is probably a problem with the Javadoc command.  A similar
       problem ocurred with Maven and Javadoc a year or so ago.</p></li>
</ul>
