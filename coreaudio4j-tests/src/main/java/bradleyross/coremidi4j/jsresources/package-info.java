 *     doc-files/index.html</a> for information on what

 *  <p>It appears that the comments in the original version used
 *     Docbook instead of Javadoc.</p>
 *  
 *  <p>I had to remove CddaPlayer and CddaRipper because they 
 *     appear to use classes that are not in the repository for
 *     Tritonus.</p>
