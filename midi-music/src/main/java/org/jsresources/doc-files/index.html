<h1>Actions of programs in org.jsresources package</h1>
<p>These classes were adapted from <a href="http://www.jsresources.org" target="_blank">
   Java Sound Resources</a> with the software repository being named jsresources at
   <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsresources" target="_blank">SourceForge.net</a></p>
<p>The software makes use of the <a href="www.tritonus.org">Tritonus: Open Source Java Sound</a>
   project.  I used a version of the jar file from the <a href="http://mvnrepository.com" target="_blank">
   Maven repository</a>.</p>
   
<h2>DumpJSInfo</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><code>java org.jsresources.DumpJSInfo</code></p>
    <p>This class prints information about the various devices
       that are part of the MIDI system.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>DumpSequence</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><code>java org.jsresources.DumpSequence /Users/bradleyross/Downloads/AGNICRT.MID</code></p>
    <p>This dumped the contents of the MIDI file in a human readable format.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>MidiFileInfo</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><code>java org.jsresources.MidiFileInfo /Users/bradleyross/Downloads/AGNICRT.MID</code></p>
    <p>This displays information about the MIDI file.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>MidiInDump</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><code>java org.jsresources.MidiInDump -l</code></p>
    <p>When I ran this command, I had a KORG nanokey controller attached.  This MIDI device
       had the name KEYBOARD and was displayed as input device 1.  Input device 3 was the
       Real Time Sequencer.</p>
    </li>
<li><p><code>java org.jsresources.MidiInDump -d KEYBOARD</code></p>
    <p>While the program was running, a line of text was displayed whenever a key on the KEYBOARD
       device was depressed or released.  This continued until the program was halted with
       CTRL-C.</p>
    </li>
<li><p><code>java.org.jsresouces.MidiInDump -n 1</code></p>
    <p>This had the same results as above since the KEYBOARD device was device number 1.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>MidiNote</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><code>java org.jsresources.MidiNote "Gervill" 38  60 10000</code></p>
    <p>Gervill was the name of the Synthesizer.  When I entered the command,
       something appeared to happen, but there was no sound.  It may be necessary to initialize the
       synthesizer.  The logical approach would be to compare the code MidiNote to MidiPlayer.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>MidiPlayer</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><code>java org.jsresources.MidiPlayer /Users/bradleyross/Downloads/AGNICRT.MID</code></p>
    <p>When the command is entered, the MIDI file is played through the speakers.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="SynthNote.html" target="_blank">SynthNote</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><code>java org.jsresources.SynthNote 1 64 120 2000</code></p>
    <p>Generated two notes</p>
    </li>
<li><p><code>java bradleyross.coremidi4j.jsresources.SynthNote 1 64 120 2000</code></p>
    <p>Generated two notes</p>
    </li>

</ul>
