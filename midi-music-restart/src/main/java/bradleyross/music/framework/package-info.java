/**
 *   The purpose of this package will be to provide a
 *   framework that can be used to provide MIDI
 *   extended implementations for multiple operating
 *   system / software combinations.
 *   
 *   <p>The classes and interfaces should include the following.</p>
 *   <ol>
 *   <li>Interfaces to be generated from {@link javax.sound.midi.MidiSystem},
 *       {@link javax.sound.midi.MidiDevice.Info}, and a few others.</li>
 *   <li>Subclasses of the interfaces that will contain methods for
 *       information about the underlying operating system services and
 *       unique identifiers of MIDI devices.</li>
 *   </ol>
